# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro timer built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Work Sessions**: 25 minutes of focused work.
- **Short Breaks**: 5 minutes of rest after each work session.
- **Long Breaks**: 20 minutes of rest after every four work sessions.
- **Visual Timer**: Displays the remaining time for work and breaks.
- **Checkmarks**: Track completed work sessions with checkmarks.
